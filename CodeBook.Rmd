## 1. Project Description
- **Objective**: To collect and analyze motion data from smartphones to identify types of human activities.
- **Tools**: Smartphones equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes to record movements.

## 2. Data Sources
- **Participants**: 30 volunteers from various age groups.
- **Activities**: Walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

## 3. Data Processing
- **Data Collection**: Data was recorded at a rate of 50 Hz.
- **Data Filtering**: Used a Butterworth filter to separate gravity and body motion signals.
- **Time Windows**: Signals were divided into 2.56-second windows with 50% overlap.

## 4. Variables and Definitions
- **Time Variables (t)**: such as tBodyAcc-XYZ, tBodyGyro-XYZ.
- **Frequency Variables (f)**: such as fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ.
- **Statistics**: such as mean (mean), standard deviation (std), energy (energy), entropy (entropy).

## 5. Statistical Outputs
- **Data Summary**: Averages and standard deviations were calculated for each window for each activity.
- **Activity Classification**: Models were used to classify the type of activity based on the extracted variables.

## 6. Data Files
- **features_info.txt**: Description of the variables used.
- **activity_labels.txt**: Links between activity labels and their names.
- **X_train.txt, y_train.txt**: Training datasets and labels.
- **X_test.txt, y_test.txt**: Test datasets and labels.

## 7. Usage and Licensing
- **Usage**: The data source must be cited in any publications that use this data.
- **License**: The data is distributed "as is" without any warranties or responsibility for its use.
