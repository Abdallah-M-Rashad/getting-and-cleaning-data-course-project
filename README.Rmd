# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the ability to collect, organize, and clean data using a dataset of recognized human activities using smartphones. The script is designed to run in the R environment, specifically using RStudio, and utilizes the dplyr library for data manipulation.

## Run the Script
To run the `run_analysis.R` script, ensure the dplyr library is installed:
```r
if (!require(dplyr)) {
    install.packages("dplyr")
    library(dplyr)
}
```
After ensuring the dplyr library is loaded, the script can be executed in the R environment to perform data collection, cleaning, and summarizing into final datasets with average values for each subject and activity.

## Project Files
- **`run_analysis.R`**: The main script for data analysis. It performs the following steps:
  - Checks for and installs the dplyr library if necessary.
  - Reads and analyzes data from the training and test datasets.
  - Merges and cleans the datasets.
  - Creates a final summarized dataset.

- **Data folder (UCI HAR Dataset)**: Contains all the raw and processed data files:
  - **Raw data files**: Include sensor data used in the analysis.
  - **Processed data files**: Contain data after the cleaning and processing phase.

- **Documentation Files**:
  - **`features_info.txt`**: Provides details about the variables used in the analysis.
  - **`activity_labels.txt`**: Contains the mapping between activity IDs and their descriptive names.
